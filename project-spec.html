Title: readLearn
Description of Project: We want to build a web app that helps someone learn a language by reading. 
They'd essentially input a (probably very long) string that could be anything from an article to a 
paragraph. Because this input text is in another language, we'd display it and allow the user to 
click the words they don't know. We'd then create a list of words they could review later.
